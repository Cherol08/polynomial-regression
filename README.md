# Polynomial Regression Algorithm
This Program applies polynomial regression algorithm to a dataset.

### What is polynomial Regression?

Polynomial regression is used to find a relationship between two variables. 
It is similar to linear regression, or rather linear regression can be regarded as a special case of polynomial
regression (since a linear expresion mx + c is a polynomial of degree 1).

The polynomia regression model allows us to interpret data which isn't simpy linear
to find a more accurate line of best fit to make more accurate predictions on future data.

### How it works

The program interprets a list of data and and trains a model to make predictions for similar
data in future. Using the model, we can find the line of best fit using polynomial expressions of
varing degrees for more accuracy.

In this program, the specific data we work with is the details of students' grades and amount of
hours they spent studying. This algorithm models the relationship between these variables.
Once processed, the program produces a  scatterplot of data.
